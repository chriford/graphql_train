Installation process for getting started with the graphql, express and node js project:
Make sure you have node installed on your machine and then run the following command:
1. clone the this project
2. run `npm init`
3. run `npm install express lodash graphql express-graphql`
To run the application you have to install nodemon, though that's optional because you can still run the application without this package, to install it just run `npm install -g nodemon`
1. and finally run `npx nodemon main` or `sudo nodemon main` or just `nodemon main`
**congratulations, the app should by default be running on port 4000**
